# Liver_cirrhosis stage prediction
# Overview
This project focuses on predicting the stage of liver cirrhosis using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various health-related features, and the project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of classification algorithms to predict the liver cirrhosis stage.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the distribution and relationships of features.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Applying Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting classifiers.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using grid search to find the best hyperparameters for the models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.

# Who Can Use This Project?
- **Healthcare Providers**: Can utilize the model to assess liver health and predict cirrhosis stages for better treatment plans.
- **Researchers**: Can explore the application of machine learning in liver disease prediction and improve early diagnosis techniques.
- **Data Scientists**: Can study the preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and implementation of classification models in healthcare.
